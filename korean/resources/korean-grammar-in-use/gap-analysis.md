# Grammar Gap Analysis - TOPIK 1 vs Korean Grammar in Use

Analysis date: 2025-12-06
Last updated: 2025-12-06

## Summary

- Total patterns in book: 112
- Patterns marked `#` (not familiar, implies not covered): 14
- Patterns marked `@` (explicitly not covered in TOPIK 1): 6
- Patterns with both marks: 1
- **Total gaps identified: 21 unique patterns**

**Note:** `#` implies `@` - if a pattern is unfamiliar, it wasn't adequately covered in TOPIK 1 examples.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify against actual TOPIK 1 data**: Run pattern matching on example sentences to confirm which patterns are truly missing
2. **Prioritize learning**: Focus on `@` patterns (likely gaps) first, then `#` patterns (unfamiliar)
3. **Create practice materials**: Generate example sentences for missing patterns using TOPIK 1 vocabulary
4. **Track progress**: Update markers as patterns become familiar

---

## Notes

- `#` = Pattern not familiar (implies not covered in TOPIK 1 examples)
- `@` = Pattern explicitly identified as not covered in TOPIK 1 examples
- **Key insight:** `#` implies `@` - unfamiliarity indicates insufficient coverage
- One pattern (V-(으)니까 ②) has both markers for emphasis

## Pattern Categories Summary

### By Unit Type:
- **Particles**: 4 gaps (3 unfamiliar + 1 not covered)
- **Time expressions**: 1 gap (unfamiliar)
- **Requests/Helping**: 1 gap (unfamiliar - specifically 주시겠어요?)
- **Conditions/Obligations**: 2 gaps (1 unfamiliar + 1 not covered)
- **Hopes/Intentions**: 2 gaps (1 unfamiliar + 1 not covered)
- **Experiences**: 1 gap (not covered)
- **Suggestions/Offers**: 3 gaps (2 not covered + 1 unfamiliar)
- **Contrast**: 1 gap (unfamiliar)
- **States**: 1 gap (unfamiliar)
- **Confirmation/Discovery**: 3 gaps (all unfamiliar)
- **Quotations**: 1 gap (unfamiliar)
- **Parts of speech**: 1 gap (unfamiliar with general pattern)

### Priority Learning Order (Suggested):

**1. High priority** (common in daily conversation):
   - V-아/어 주세요/주시겠어요? (please do) - common request form
   - V-(으)ㄴ 적이 있다 (have done before) - discussing experience
   - A/V-지 않아도 되다 (don't need to) - expressing lack of obligation
   - N(이)나 (or) - basic choice expression
   - N처럼/같이 (like) - comparisons

**2. Medium priority** (useful for expression):
   - A/V-겠어요 ① (I will - intention) - expressing willingness
   - A/V-겠어요 ② (must be - conjecture) - making guesses
   - V-기로 하다 (decide to) - talking about decisions
   - A/V-았/었으면 좋겠다 (I hope) - expressing wishes
   - V-(으)ㅂ시다 (let's) - formal suggestions
   - V-(으)시겠어요? (would you like?) - polite offers
   - A/V-거나 (or) - alternative actions

**3. Lower priority** (more advanced/specific):
   - V-(으)ㄴ 지 (since/how long) - time elapsed
   - V-(으)려면 (if you want to) - conditional with intention
   - V-(으)니까 ② (when/upon) - temporal sequence
   - V-아/어 있다 (resultant state) - nuanced state expression
   - A-아/어하다 (emotion verb pattern) - grammatical understanding
   - A/V-지요? (formal confirmation) - know casual -죠 already
   - A/V-군요 (discovery) - know casual 구나 already
   - A-(으)ㄴ가요?, V-나요? (question form)
   - Quotation contracted forms - advanced grammar
