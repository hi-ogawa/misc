Reference material from the textbook "Korean Grammar in Use - Beginning" (112 patterns).

## Files

- `toc.md` - Table of contents with example sentences and gap markers
- `gap-analysis.md` - Analysis of gaps vs TOPIK 1 coverage
- `plan-anki-cards.md` - Plan for generating Anki cards from gaps

## Workflow

1. Dumped book's table of contents into `toc.md`
2. Agent enhanced with one-liner example sentences
3. Skimmed content and marked gaps:
   - `#` = not familiar (implies not covered in TOPIK 1)
   - `@` = explicitly not covered in TOPIK 1
4. Agent generated `gap-analysis.md` from markers

## Status

- [x] TOC with examples
- [x] Gap markers added
- [x] Review gap-analysis.md
- [ ] Generate Anki cards for 21 gap patterns
