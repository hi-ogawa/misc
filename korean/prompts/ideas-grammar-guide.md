# Idea: Grammar Guide Generation

## Problem

Current grammar learning approach:
- Sporadic deep-dive chats on Claude web (verb conjugation, particles, etc.)
- Hard to reference later - scattered across many conversations
- No systematic organization

## Potential Solutions

1. **Classic grammar book**: "Korean Grammar in Use" or TTMIK books for structured reference

2. **Consolidate existing chats**: Extract final tables/rules from web chats into markdown files
   - Example: verb conjugation tables from existing chat are quite complete

3. **Generate with Claude Code**: Easier to iterate than web chats
   - Can build incrementally in `guides/` folder
   - Version controlled
   - But: markdown not ideal for actual review/study

## Notes

- User's actual grammar knowledge is higher than "beginner" curriculum assumes
- Deep-dives include: verb conjugation (all irregulars), particles, honorifics, derivation patterns
- This could inform example sentence requirements (i+1 principle - exploit known grammar)

## Status

Idea noted for future consideration. No immediate action planned.
