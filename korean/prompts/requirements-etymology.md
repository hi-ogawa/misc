Goal: Generate etymology information showing word origins and derivations.

REQUIREMENTS:
- **Core principle: Show the origin and structure of Korean words to aid learning and memory**
  - Etymology helps understand how words are built and relate to other languages
  - Shows connections between Korean, Chinese, and Japanese
  - Reveals internal structure of compound and derived words

- **Etymology types to include:**

  1. **SINO-KOREAN (한자어 / 日本漢字)**:
     - 희망 → "希望"
     - 학생 → "學生 / 学生"
     - 가격 → "價格 / 価格"

     **CRITICAL: Always show BOTH traditional Chinese (Hanja) and Japanese kanji when they differ.**

     Examples of correct format:
     - 價格 / 価格 (NOT just 價格)
     - 簡單 / 簡単 (NOT just 簡單)
     - 經驗 / 経験 (NOT just 經驗)
     - 學校 / 学校 (NOT just 學校)

     When they are identical, show once:
     - 希望 (same in both Chinese and Japanese)
     - 會社 (same in both, though not common in Korean)

     Rationale:
     - Shows relationship between Korean Hanja and Japanese kanji
     - Reveals simplification differences (e.g., 價 vs 価, 學 vs 学)
     - Useful for learners of both Korean and Japanese
     - Helps distinguish traditional vs simplified forms

  2. **DERIVATIONS (파생어)**:
     Compound verbs or words formed by combining a root with affixes

     - 가져가다 → "가지다 + 가다"
     - 걸어가다 → "걷다 + 가다"
     - 먹어보다 → "먹다 + 보다"

     Format: Show roots separated with " + "

  3. **COMPOUNDS (합성어)**:
     Words formed by combining two or more roots

     - 눈물 → "눈 + 물"
     - 손가락 → "손 + 가락"
     - 햇빛 → "해 + 빛"
     - 강아지 → "개 + 아지"

     **IMPORTANT: For compounds with sound changes, use the ORIGINAL root form**
     - 강아지 comes from 개 (dog) + 아지, so write "개 + 아지" (NOT "강 + 아지")
     - 냇가 comes from 내 (stream) + 가, so write "내 + 가" (NOT "냇 + 가")
     - Show the root BEFORE sound change occurred

     Rationale:
     - Shows the semantic composition of the word
     - Helps learners understand word-building patterns
     - Reveals underlying meaning through components

  4. **LOANWORDS (외래어)**:
     Words borrowed from other languages

     - 컴퓨터 → "computer"
     - 아르바이트 → "アルバイト / Arbeit"
     - 빵 → "パン / pão"

     **Format**: Just the source word, no language labels in parentheses

     **For multi-hop borrowing** (language A → language B → Korean):
     - Show the path with "/"
     - Example: 아르바이트 → "アルバイト / Arbeit" (German → Japanese → Korean)
     - Example: 빵 → "パン / pão" (Portuguese → Japanese → Korean)

     **For direct borrowing**:
     - Just show the source word
     - Example: 컴퓨터 → "computer"
     - Example: 버스 → "bus"

  5. **SKIP: Pure Korean words with no clear etymology**
     - Native Korean words without analyzable structure: leave blank
     - Examples: 가다, 먹다, 좋다, 예쁘다
     - Only show etymology when it provides meaningful learning value

- **Quality guidelines:**
  - Accuracy: Verify etymology is correct
  - Clarity: Format should be immediately understandable (minimal, no explanations)
  - Consistency: Use same format patterns throughout
  - Learning value: Only include etymology when it helps understanding
  - Minimal format: Show only the essential information without labels or extra text
