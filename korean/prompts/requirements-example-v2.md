# Example Sentence Requirements - Version 2 (1b8d66a)

**Note**: This version introduced "SIMPLE and MINIMAL" guidance. See `requirements-example.md` for current version.

---

Goal: Generate example sentences for each vocabulary item.

**QUALITY CHECKLIST - Every example must pass ALL checks:**
1. ✓ Contains the vocabulary word (verb conjugated, noun exact, adjective natural form)
2. ✓ Has explicit subject (주어) - WHO or WHAT is doing the action?
3. ✓ Subject/object must be CONCRETE, SPECIFIC nouns (not 이거, 그거, 저거, 그것, 이것, 사람)
4. ✓ Has at least one verb AND one noun
5. ✓ Includes particles (을/를, 이/가, 에서, 에, 한테, etc.)
6. ✓ Has at least ONE concrete context element (time/place/manner/specific object)
7. ✓ Is VISUALIZABLE - can you picture a concrete scene from the sentence?
8. ✓ NOT using generic patterns (주세요, 있어요, 만났어요 alone)
9. ✓ Shows distinctive/characteristic usage of the word

REQUIREMENTS:
- **CRITICAL: The example sentence MUST contain the vocabulary word from the "korean" column**
  - For verbs: use the verb stem in conjugated form (e.g., 가지다 → 가져요, 가지고, 가진)
  - For adjectives: use the stem in any natural form (e.g., 가볍다 → 가벼운, 가벼워요)
  - For nouns: use the exact noun (e.g., 가족 → 가족이랑)
  - NEVER substitute with synonyms or different words

- **Core principle: Example must help conceptualize the word through distinctive context**
  - Ask: "Does this example show what makes THIS word different from similar words?"
  - Show characteristic or typical usage, not just grammatically correct patterns
  - Example should enable visualizing a concrete situation even without knowing the target word

- **Sentence structure requirements:**
  - Must include at least one noun (명사) AND one verb (동사)
  - Prefer complete sentences over noun phrases
  - **Keep sentences SIMPLE and MINIMAL - one main idea only**
    - ❌ Avoid compound sentences: "엄마가 프라이팬에 기름을 두르고 계란을 부쳤어요" (Too long - two actions)
    - ✅ Simple sentence: "엄마가 계란을 기름에 부쳤어요" (One clear action)
    - ❌ Avoid clauses: "소풍 갈 때 엄마가 김밥을 싸 주셨어요" (Time clause + main clause)
    - ✅ Simple: "엄마가 소풍 도시락에 김밥을 쌌어요" (One statement)
  - Add enough detail to make the scene CONCRETE and VISUALIZABLE, but no more
  - **ALWAYS include particles (가/이, 는/은, 를/을, etc.) explicitly for learning purposes**
  - **NEVER drop the subject (주어) - ALWAYS include it explicitly**
    - ❌ "고장이 났어요" (What broke? Subject missing! Not visualizable)
    - ✅ "자전거가 고장 났어요" (Specific object - bicycle)

- **Avoid generic/overused patterns:**
  - ❌ Generic verbs like 주세요, 있어요, 만났어요, 오세요 (unless specifically characteristic)
    - ❌ 기름을 좀 주세요 (could be any noun, subject dropped)
    - ✅ 생선을 기름에 튀겼어요 (shows what you DO with oil, explicit object)
  - ❌ Filler words like 좀, 너무 (unless they add meaningful context)
    - ❌ 계산을 좀 해 주세요 (generic request, subject dropped)
    - ✅ 이번 계산이 복잡해요 (shows characteristic of calculations, adds context)
  - ❌ Too generic contexts that could apply to anything
    - ❌ "고등학생이 공부해요" (Where? What subject? Too generic)
    - ✅ "고등학생이 도서관에서 수학을 공부해요" (Location + specific subject matter)
  - Test: Can this sentence work with many different nouns/verbs? If yes, make it more specific

- **Prefer distinctive, concrete elements:**
  - ✅ Concrete nouns instead of pronouns/demonstratives
    - ❌ "이거 주세요" (What is "this"? No concrete context)
    - ✅ "물 한 잔 주세요" (Concrete object + counter)
    - ❌ "그것이 필요해요" (What is "that"? Too abstract)
    - ✅ "회의 자료가 필요해요" (Specific concrete noun)
  - ✅ Specific nouns instead of generic ones
    - ❌ "사람이 왔어요" (Which person? Not specific enough)
    - ✅ "친구가 집에 왔어요" (Specific relationship + location)
    - ❌ "기자를 만났어요" (Could be anyone, too bare)
    - ✅ "기자가 여러 질문을 했어요" (Shows what journalists DO, visualizable)
  - ✅ Characteristic actions that show word's typical usage
    - ❌ "내일 가져올게요" (What will you bring? Too vague)
    - ✅ "내일 우산을 가져올게요" (Specific object, concrete)
  - ✅ Concrete spatial/temporal/situational context
    - ❌ "가운데에 앉으세요" (Middle of what? No context)
    - ✅ "방 가운데에 테이블이 있어요" (Specific location, visualizable scene)
  - ✅ Semantic relationships and contrasts
    - Okay: "과일 겉은 딱딱해요" (Shows literal "outer surface")
    - Better: "겉과 속이 달라요" (Shows surface vs inside contrast)
  - Exception: When the vocabulary word itself IS a pronoun/demonstrative (이거, 그거, etc.), use it but add maximum concrete context:
    - For 이거: "이거는 제가 어제 산 책이에요" (Adds concrete noun "책" + time)

- **Word type specific guidelines:**
  - **Adjectives**: Often better with modifying form + noun + verb
    - Example: 가볍다 → "가벼운 가방을 샀어요" (not bare "가방이 가벼워요")
  - **Verbs**: Use with objects/locations that show characteristic usage
    - Example: 가르치다 → "친구한테 영어를 가르쳐요" (explicit recipient and object)
  - **Nouns**: Show what you DO with them or where they typically appear
    - Example: 가족 → "가족이랑 같이 살아요" (adds manner/companionship)
  - **Adverbs**: Use in natural sentences with specific context
    - Example: 꼭 → "친구가 내일 꼭 와야 해요" (not bare "꼭 오세요")

- **Must include at least ONE concrete context element** (location/time/manner/specific object)
  - ❌ "나비가 날아다녀요" (Too bare - where? when? how?)
  - ✅ "나비가 꽃 사이를 날아다녀요" (Location - among flowers)
  - ❌ "공을 던져요" (Too bare - who? where? Not visualizable)
  - ✅ "동생이 공을 높이 던져요" (Subject + manner - can picture the scene)

- **For pedagogical purposes, prefer explicit subjects/objects over natural ellipsis**
  - Goal: Create concrete mental images and word associations
  - ❌ 갑자기 나타났어요 (grammatically fine, but lacks learning context)
  - ✅ 친구가 갑자기 나타났어요 (clear who appeared)
  - ❌ 구워 먹었어요 (too vague for vocabulary learning)
  - ✅ 김을 구워 먹었어요 (what you do with seaweed)
