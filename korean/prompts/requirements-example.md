Goal: Generate example sentences for each vocabulary item.

REQUIREMENTS:
- **CRITICAL: The example sentence MUST contain the vocabulary word from the "korean" column**
  - For verbs: use the verb stem in conjugated form (e.g., 가지다 → 가져요, 가지고, 가진)
  - For adjectives: use the stem in any natural form (e.g., 가볍다 → 가벼운, 가벼워요)
  - For nouns: use the exact noun (e.g., 가족 → 가족이랑)
  - NEVER substitute with synonyms or different words

- **Core principle: Example must help conceptualize the word through distinctive context**
  - Ask: "Does this example show what makes THIS word different from similar words?"
  - Show characteristic or typical usage, not just grammatically correct patterns
  - Example should enable visualizing a concrete situation even without knowing the target word

- **Sentence structure requirements:**
  - Must include at least one noun (명사) AND one verb (동사)
  - Prefer complete sentences over noun phrases
  - Keep sentences minimal but context-rich: 3-5 words ideal
  - **ALWAYS include particles (가/이, 는/은, 를/을, etc.) explicitly for learning purposes**

- **Avoid generic/overused patterns:**
  - ❌ Generic verbs like 주세요, 있어요, 만났어요, 오세요 (unless specifically characteristic)
    - Bad: 기름을 좀 주세요 (could be any noun)
    - Good: 기름에 튀겼어요 (shows what you DO with oil)
  - ❌ Filler words like 좀, 너무 (unless they add meaningful context)
    - Bad: 계산을 좀 해 주세요 (generic request)
    - Good: 계산이 복잡해요 (shows characteristic of calculations)
  - ❌ Missing critical context elements
    - Bad: 갑자기 나타났어요 (who/what appeared?)
    - Good: 친구가 갑자기 나타났어요 (clear subject)
  - Test: Can this sentence work with many different nouns/verbs? If yes, make it more specific

- **Prefer distinctive elements:**
  - ✅ Specific objects/subjects over generic ones
    - Bad: 기자를 만났어요 (could be anyone)
    - Good: 기자가 질문했어요 (shows what journalists DO)
  - ✅ Characteristic actions that show word's typical usage
    - Bad: 내일 가져올게요 (what will you bring?)
    - Good: 우산을 가져올게요 (specific object)
  - ✅ Concrete spatial/temporal/situational context
    - Bad: 가운데에 앉으세요 (middle of what?)
    - Good: 방 가운데에 테이블이 있어요 (specific location)
  - ✅ Show semantic relationships and contrasts
    - Mechanical: 겉은 딱딱해요 (shows literal "outer surface")
    - Good: 겉과 속이 달라요 (shows surface vs inside contrast)

- **Word type specific guidelines:**
  - **Adjectives**: Often better with modifying form + noun + verb
    - Example: 가볍다 → "가벼운 가방을 샀어요" (not "가방이 가벼워요")
  - **Verbs**: Use with objects/locations that show characteristic usage
    - Example: 가르치다 → "영어를 가르쳐 주세요"
  - **Nouns**: Show what you DO with them or where they typically appear
    - Example: 가족 → "가족이랑 살아요"
  - **Adverbs**: Use in natural sentences with specific context
    - Example: 꼭 → "내일 꼭 와야 해요" (not just "꼭 오세요")

- **Minimum 3 어절 (spacing units) and 4 or more encouraged** 
  - 2 어절 patterns are usually too bare: 불이 났어요, 공을 던져요
  - 3+ 어절 forces additional context: 갑자기 불이 났어요, 공을 높이 던져요

- **Must include at least ONE concrete context element** (location/time/manner/specific noun)
  - This catches: "나비가 날아다녀요" (3 어절 but no context)
  - Forces: "나비가 꽃 사이를 날아다녀요" (5 어절 + location)

- **For pedagogical purposes, prefer explicit subjects/objects over natural ellipsis**
  - Goal: Create concrete mental images and word associations
  - ✅ 친구가 갑자기 나타났어요 (clear who appeared)
  - ❌ 갑자기 나타났어요 (grammatically fine, but lacks learning context)
  - ✅ 김을 구워 먹었어요 (what you do with seaweed)
  - ❌ 구워 먹었어요 (too vague for vocabulary learning)
