Generate related vocabulary words for the "notes" field (TOPIK 2).

## Requirements

**All generation requirements are in `prompts/requirements-notes.md`**

Read and follow all requirements before generating notes.

## Input/Output Format

**Input**: Two-step approach for cross-referencing
1. **Vocabulary reference** (read first): `input/korean.tsv`
   - Contains: All Korean vocabulary (5720 words: TOPIK 1 + TOPIK 2)
   - Format: Single column, one word per line, no header
   - Purpose: Bring full vocabulary into context for cross-referencing

2. **Batch file** (read second): `input/koreantopik2-batch-N.tsv`
   - Contains: Assigned batch only (100 entries + header)
   - Columns: number, korean, english
   - Purpose: Explicit list of entries to generate notes for

**Rationale**:
- Reading vocab reference first enables finding related words across all vocabulary
- Antonyms may be far apart (e.g., 높다 in TOPIK 1, 낮다 in TOPIK 2)
- Honorific pairs span across TOPIK levels
- Confusables benefit from seeing all similar words
- Batch file makes it explicit which entries to process

**Output**: TSV files (tab-separated) - ONLY for assigned batch
- Columns: number, korean, notes
- Relationship types: related meanings, antonyms, family pairs, honorific pairs, Hanja-순우리말 pairs, confusables
- Leave blank if no meaningful related words
- Output files:
  - `output/koreantopik2/notes-1.tsv` (entries 1-100 ONLY)
  - `output/koreantopik2/notes-2.tsv` (entries 101-200 ONLY)
  - ...
  - `output/koreantopik2/notes-39.tsv` (entries 3801-3873 ONLY)

## Process

1. Read `prompts/requirements-notes.md` for complete generation requirements
2. Read `input/korean.tsv` (all vocabulary for cross-referencing)
3. Read `input/koreantopik2-batch-N.tsv` (assigned batch of 100 entries)
4. Generate related words ONLY for entries in the batch file
5. Write output to corresponding batch file
6. Process directly using Korean language understanding (no script-based automation)

## Execution Strategy

**Use subagents for isolated context generation:**

Each batch should be generated by a separate agent to ensure:
- Fresh context per batch (no cross-contamination)
- Consistent application of requirements
- Parallel execution capability

**Per-batch agent task:**
1. Read `prompts/requirements-notes.md`
2. Read `input/korean.tsv` (vocabulary reference - 5720 words)
3. Read `input/koreantopik2-batch-N.tsv` (assigned batch file)
4. Generate related words ONLY for entries in batch file
5. Write `output/koreantopik2/notes-N.tsv`

**CRITICAL: Avoid context contamination:**
- **DO NOT read any existing output files** (notes-*.tsv)
- **DO NOT look at other batches** for inspiration or reference
- Generate notes from scratch based ONLY on requirements
- Each agent must work independently with fresh context

**Benefits of vocabulary reference approach:**
- Agents can find related words across ALL vocabulary (TOPIK 1 + TOPIK 2)
- Better quality cross-referencing (antonyms, honorific pairs, confusables)
- Vocabulary reference is lightweight (just Korean words, no metadata)
- Can find relationships across TOPIK levels (e.g., TOPIK 1 word related to TOPIK 2 word)
- Batch file makes it explicit which entries to process
- Each agent outputs ONLY their assigned batch (100 words)

**Launch agents:**
- Can run sequentially (1-39) or in parallel batches
- Each agent receives identical instructions but different batch files
- No shared state between agents
