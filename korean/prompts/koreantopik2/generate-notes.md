Generate related vocabulary words for the "notes" field (TOPIK 2).

## Requirements

**All generation requirements are in `prompts/requirements-notes.md`**

Read and follow all requirements before generating notes.

## Input/Output Format

**Input**: FULL vocabulary list (not pre-split)
- Source: `input/koreantopik2.tsv` (all 3873 entries)
- Columns: number, korean, english
- **Rationale**: Finding related words requires cross-referencing the entire vocabulary
  - Antonyms may be far apart (e.g., 높다 at entry 100, 낮다 at entry 2500)
  - Honorific pairs span the full vocabulary range
  - Confusables benefit from seeing all similar words
  - Better quality notes when agent can search across all 3873 words

**Output**: TSV files (tab-separated) - ONLY for assigned batch range
- Columns: number, korean, notes
- Relationship types: related meanings, antonyms, family pairs, honorific pairs, Hanja-순우리말 pairs, confusables
- Leave blank if no meaningful related words
- Output files:
  - `output/koreantopik2/notes-1.tsv` (entries 1-100 ONLY)
  - `output/koreantopik2/notes-2.tsv` (entries 101-200 ONLY)
  - ...
  - `output/koreantopik2/notes-39.tsv` (entries 3801-3873 ONLY)

## Process

1. Read `prompts/requirements-notes.md` for complete generation requirements
2. Process input file in batches of 100 entries
3. Generate related words following all requirements
4. Write output to corresponding batch file
5. Process directly using Korean language understanding (no script-based automation)

## Execution Strategy

**Use subagents for isolated context generation:**

Each batch should be generated by a separate agent to ensure:
- Fresh context per batch (no cross-contamination)
- Consistent application of requirements
- Parallel execution capability

**Per-batch agent task:**
1. Read `prompts/requirements-notes.md`
2. Read `input/koreantopik2.tsv` (FULL vocabulary - all 3873 entries for cross-referencing)
3. Generate related words ONLY for assigned range (e.g., batch 1 = entries 1-100)
4. Write `output/koreantopik2/notes-N.tsv` (contains ONLY entries for that batch range)

**CRITICAL: Avoid context contamination:**
- **DO NOT read any existing output files** (notes-*.tsv)
- **DO NOT look at other batches** for inspiration or reference
- Generate notes from scratch based ONLY on requirements
- Each agent must work independently with fresh context

**Benefits of full vocabulary access:**
- Agents can find related words anywhere in the 3873-word vocabulary
- Better quality cross-referencing (antonyms, honorific pairs, confusables)
- More comprehensive notes field
- Each agent still outputs ONLY their assigned batch (100 words)

**Launch agents:**
- Can run sequentially (1-39) or in parallel batches
- Each agent receives identical instructions but different batch files
- No shared state between agents
